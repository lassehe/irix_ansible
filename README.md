# irix_ansible

Configures an already-installed IRIX system.

## Requirements

* Host with ansible installed
* IRIX target host with telnet available

## Usage

Make a new file ~/.vault_pass.txt with your vault password in it. If your password is 'password', the file will only contain 'password'.

Delete group_vars/default/vault.yml , and make your own file that looks like this:

```
---
su_password: your_passwd
```

Then encrypt it:

```
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/default/vault.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
```

Examine and modify the inventory.yml file (in the top level directory) to match your local requirements.

Run the bootstrap playbook on a system that has just been installed. It expects the root password to be blank.

This playbook will:

* create an 'ansible' user
* copy several bundles via ftp
* install wget, python, and openssh
* start sshd

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml bootstrap.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
```

Examine and modify the master_setup playbook to your liking, then run it. You can comment out unneeded roles.

The master_setup playbook currently:

* installs nekodeps
* installs base packages
* sets up bash as an available shell
* adds a user
* enables remote x11
* configures ntp
* installs findutils
* performs security hardening

```
ansible-playbook  -i inventory.yml -u ansible master_setup.yml -k  --become-method=su --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
```

When prompted for "SSH password", enter 'ansible'.
